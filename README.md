# Prerequisites

- NPM `">=11.6.2"`
- Node `">=24.13.0"`

- Clone the repo down to your machine
- Run `npm install`
- Copy the WSDL files for the Bank Wizard and Token Service into the root of the project
- Copy template.env to .env and fill out the required environment variables

If you're planning to connect to the remote Experian servers
- Copy the appropriate SSL Certificates into `/ssl/experian{prod/uat}/`

## Using Experian Bankwizard

Due to IP restriction restraints, a stub has been developed to run in place of a remote server when developing locally.
To use this run configuration, set the `BANKWIZARD_URL` and `TOKEN_SERVICE_URL` environment variables to `http://localhost:3100/wsdl` and run `npm run start:stub`

If using the UAT or Production Experian servers instead, set the `BANKWIZARD_URL` and `TOKEN_SERVICE_URL` environment variables to the remote servers and run `npm run start:dev`

To start the service as in production (without nodemon) set the environment variables and run `npm start`

Once the service is running the API docs can be accessed at `http://localhost:3100/docs`
